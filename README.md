Get Meemsign Autograph NFT From Influencers, Celebgrams, Celebrities, And Other Idols

The Wonderous Bridge Between Fans And Idols

What is Meemsign?

Meemsign Autograph NFT is an online platform where fans can get autographs from idols such as social media influencers, celebgrams, celebrities etc. This digital autograph can be an interesting image or short video with an interesting title generated and uploaded by fan, and later signed digitally by the idol. And then, in order to preserve the economic value of each autograph, we will store it in the form of NFT - a Metaverse digital asset with digital certificate on blockchain. This NFT technology will create scarcity of each autograph, so this memorabilia can also function as asset which can later be sold again.

We simplify autograph request, so you don't have to queue up in line for hours anymore.
